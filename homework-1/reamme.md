## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Although my major is not web dev I still really enjoy working with code and seeing how websites are created. I feel pretty proficient when it comes to working with VS code.

### VS Code & Extensions

I have already taken a coding class and also am a tutor for N115 but this has been a great refresher! I am learning new stuff about VS code such as how to create readme files!

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

I had a bit of an issue creating a new repository but after that everything worked out. I found cyber duck to be really hard and difficult so I like this easier alternative.

### Markdown & Documentation

The markdown is pretty simple I feel, especially with the shortcuts we're being taught. Use this link!! https://iu.instructure.com/courses/2298808/pages/markdown-basics?module_item_id=34165591
